## Career Highlights
With engineering and finance behind my back, I am currently engaged in research in the emerging new field of ‘data-driven policy-making,’ where we are pioneering the use of advanced data science and machine learning techniques on an abundance of public sector data. I can turn data into meaningful, interpretable models. I am valued as a contributor in this field for my knowledge of both classical finance, econometrics, and economic theory, on top of my advanced predictive analytics and business intelligence skills using cutting edge tools like Python, R, SQL, Tableau, etc.
## Research Experience
-	Use supervised and unsupervised deep learning to optimize federal and state-level employment incentives, enabling targeted policy implementations 
- Apply big data and ML algorithms for targeting under-funded segments of the state economy for spurring economic growth
- Teach graduate students applied statistics using R, Python, ArcGIS, and STATA
- Participate national and international conferences focused on policy reseach and application of evidence based policy analysis
## Data Projects
- Working with Precinct-level election data (Texas) and CPS data to detect dormant Hispanic voters, using ArcGIS and Python
- Analyzing O*NET and BLS dataset using MySQL, R, and Tableau to predict job vulnerability and the skill set required for the fourth industrial revolution
- Combining social mobility and redistribution data to measure federal policy impact on youth employment applying SVAR model using Python
- Detecting land-use change in the DFW area using LANDSAT images and ArcMap, producing numerous geo-coded visualizations
- Predicting impact on jobs due to AI in inaccessible areas using block-level employment data and ArcGIS Pro
- Predicting locust infestation in the northern part of Bangladesh using NOAA NDVI satellite images and 'soil grid' raster dataset
- Finding how impact of Covid-19 is racially biased in terms of imact on employment
